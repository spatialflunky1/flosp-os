Functions
----------
void initialize_video(BOOT_VIDEO_MODE_INFO* VMI)
    Set the VideoModeInfo variable used by other VGA Functions and call `blank_output()`

void blank_output(void)
    Fill the screen with black pixels

void kputchar(const unsigned char c)
    Puts the character `c` at the next location specified by `text_col_px` and `text_line`

void kscroll_down(void)
    Scrolls all text on the screen up by one line

void kprint(const char* s)
    Iterates through the char array `s` and calls kputchar for the individual characters

void kprint_hex(ui64_t h, const ui8_t zero_x)
void kprint_num(ui64_t n)
    Both of these functions work roughly the same just with a different divisor when doing the math: divides by 10 or 16 and adds the remainder to a char stack

void backspace(void)
    Clears the last character and sets the text cursor position to the previous location
