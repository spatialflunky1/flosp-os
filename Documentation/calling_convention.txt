To break away from the traditional calling conventions of Unix and Windows
Flosp will have it's own standard calling convention as listed below. This
calling convention is subject to change as the operating system grows in
development (ex. floating point parameters: xmm)

All registers are conserved except for ax/rax being the register for returning
values.


16 bit (bootloader):

result,   1st   ,   2nd   ,   3rd   
------ --------- --------- ---------
  ax      bx        cx        dx


64 bit (OS):

result,   1st   ,   2nd   ,   3rd   
------ --------- --------- ---------
 rax      rbx       rcx       rdx
