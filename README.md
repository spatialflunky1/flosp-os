# Flosp OS
## Description
My first attempt at creating an operating system from the ground up  
## Note
The project is now archived - rebuilding from the ground up  
  
Two main reasons behind this:
* Many choices were made to write complete functions at a later time which led to a great pileup of uncomplete and rough implementations
* Knowledge base has increased since this project's conception and there is much to improve upon
## Build Dependencies
