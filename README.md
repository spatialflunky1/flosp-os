# Flosp OS
## Description
My first attempt at creating an operating system from scratch
## Notes
* The scripts in the tools folder are used to format and write the boot binary to a floppy disc  
  - Will get removed once the OS starts to exceed 1.44 MB, or when starting long mode
  - If you use these tools: MAKE SURE TO CHANGE THE DRIVE DEVICE PATH IN THE SCRIPTS (format.sh & write.sh) TO MATCH YOUR FDD
