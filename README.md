# flosp OS
## Description
My first attempt at creating an operating system from scratch
## Notes
* The operating system itself has not started development yet
* This repository is currently used to hold test programs I create which I am using to learn assembly
* The scripts in the tools folder are used to format and write the boot binary to a floppy disc  
  - Will get removed once the programs start to exceed 1.44 MB
  - If you use these tools: MAKE SURE TO CHANGE THE DRIVE IN THE SCRIPT TO MATCH YOUR FDD
