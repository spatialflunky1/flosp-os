# Flosp OS
## Description
My first attempt at creating an operating system from scratch
## Notes
* This repository also contains test programs I create which I am using to learn assembly
* The scripts in the tools folder are used to format and write the boot binary to a floppy disc  
  - Will get removed once the OS start to exceed 1.44 MB, or when I start using long mode
  - If you use these tools: MAKE SURE TO CHANGE THE DRIVE IN THE SCRIPT TO MATCH YOUR FDD
